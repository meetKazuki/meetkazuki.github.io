Hey there, I'm Desmond Edem, a Backend Engineer driven by a simple philosophy: **Learn**. **Improve**. **Contribute**. Welcome to my little corner of the internet...

For the past several years, I've been building and scaling backend systems that power modern web applications. At **[STRV](https://www.strv.com/)**, I had the privilege
of leading the technical architecture for multiple startup projects, turning client visions into reality, with little/affordable operational costs. My focus has always
been on creating robust, scalable solutions that can grow from a minimum viable product to handle a **5x** increase in workload without a major overhaul.

Before that, at **[Pettysave](https://jetseed.com/)**, I discovered the power of automation, implementing systems that boosted customer retention, and improving pipelines
to enhance team collaboration.

### Beyond the Code

My passion for technology extends beyond my professional work. I explore other things that piques my curiosity&mdash;from *video games* to now, *homelabs* and *self-hosting*
The latter of which has driven me to share these journeys. I'm excited to document! So, what will I write about? Answer, everything!

I believe strongly in giving back to the community. I've had the honor of mentoring developers at **DevCareer**, and tutoring for **CodeLagos**, helping others start
their own journeys in tech.
